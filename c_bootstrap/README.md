This is a version of the B compiler written in C.  It is written to be as close to a B version as I can reasonably make it.  I am also including libraries that look a lot like the B libraries.  Since I don't have a B compiler and want to write one in B, I need to "bootstrap" it.  By writing in C and making it as much like B as I can, porting it to itself "should" be pretty easy.  We shall see.
