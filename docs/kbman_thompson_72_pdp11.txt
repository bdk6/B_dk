ABSTRACT
B is a computer language intended for recursive, primarily non-
numeric applications typified by system programming.  B has a
small, unrestrictive syntax that is easy to compile.  Because of
the unusual freedom of expression and a rich set of operators, B
programs are often quite compact.

This manual contains a concise definition of the language, sample
programs, and instructions for using the PDP-11 version of B.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE

1.0 Introduction
B is a computer language directly descendent from BCPL [1,2].  B
is running at Murray Hill on the DEC PDP-11 computer under the
UNIX-11 time sharing system [3,4].  B is good for recursive,
non-numeric, machine independent applications, such as system and
language work.

B, compared to BCPL, is syntactically rich in expressions and
syntactically poor in statements.  A look at the examples in sec-
tion 9 of this document will give a flavor of the language.

B was designed and implemented by D. M. Ritchie and the author.

2.0 Syntax
The syntactic notation in this manual is basically BNF with the
following exceptions:
  1.  the metacharacters < and > are removed.  Literals are
      underlined to differentiate them from syntactic variables.
  2.  the metacharacter | is removed.  Each syntactic alternative
      is placed on a separate line.
  3. The metacharacters { and } denote syntactic grouping.

                               - 2 -

  4.  A syntactic group followed by numerical sub- and super-
      scripts denote repetition of the group as follows:
         { ..}m   m, m+1, ...
	 { .. }m n m, m+1, ...,n

2.1  Canonical Syntax
The syntax given in this section defines all the legal construc-
tions in B without specifying the association rules.  These are
given later along with the semantic description of each construc-
tion.

2.2 Comments and Character Sets

----- page
                       - 5 -

Comments are delimited as in PL/I by /* and */.

In general, B requires tokens to be separated by blanks, comments
or newlines, however the compiler infers separators surrounding
any of the characters () {} [],;?: or surrounding any maximal se-
quence of the characters +-*/<>&:!.

The character set used in B in ANSCII.

The syntactic variable 'alpha' is not defined.  It represents the
characters A to Z, a to z, _, and backspace.

The syntactic variable 'digit' is not defined.  It represents the
characters 0, 1, 2, ... 9.

They syntactic variable 'char' is not defined.  It is essentially
any character in the set plus the escape character '*' followed
by another character to represent characters not easily
represented in the set.  The following escape sequences are
currently defined.
  *0  null
  *e  end of file
  *(  {
  *)  }
  *t  tab
  **  *
  *'  '
  *"  "
  *n  new line

All keywords in the language are only recognized in lower case.
Keywords are reserved.

3.0 Rvalues and Lvalues
----- page
                        - 6 -

An rvalue is a binary bit pattern of a fixed length.  On the
PDP-11 it is 16 bits.  Objects are rvalues of different kinds
such as integers, labels, vectors and functions.  The actual kind
of object represented is called the type of the rvalue.

A B expression can be evaluated to yield an rvalue, but its type
is undefined until the rvalue is used in some context.  It is
then assumed to represent an object of the required type.  For
example, in the following function call
      (b?f:g[i])(1,x>1)
The expression (b?f:g[1]) is evaluated to yield an rvalue which
is interpreted to be of type function. Whether f and g[i] are in
fact functions is not checked.  Similarly, b is assumed to be of
type truth value, x to be of type integer etc.

There is no check to insure that there are no type mismatches.
Similarly, there are no wanted, or unwanted, type conversions.

An lvalue is a bit pattern representing a storage location con-
taining an rvalue.  An lvalue is a type in B.  The unary operator
* can be used to interpret an rvalue as an lvalue.  Thus
      *x
evaluates the expression x to yield an rvalue, which is then
interpreted as an lvalue.  If it is then used in an rvalue con-
text, the application of * yields the rvalue therein stored.  The
operator * can be thought of as indirection.

The unary operator & can be used to interpret an lvalue as an
rvalue.  Thus
----- page
                         - 7 -

      &x
evaluates the expression x as an lvalue.  The application of &
then yields the lvalue as an rvalue.  The operator & can there-
fore be thought of as the address function.

The names lvalue and rvalue come from the assignment statement
which requires an lvalue on the left and an rvalue on the right.

4.0 Expression Evaluation
Binding of expressions (lvalues and rvalues) is in the same order
as the sub-sections of this section except as noted.  Thus ex-
pressions referred to as operands of '+' (section 4.4) are ex-
pressions defined in sections 4.1 to 4.3.  The binding of opera-
tors at the same level (left to right, right to left) is speci-
fied in each sub-section.

4.1 Primary Expressions
   1. A name is an lvalue of one of three storage classes (au-
      tomatic, external, internal).
   2. A decimal constant is an rvalue.  It consists of a digit
      between 1 and 9 followed by any number of digits between 0
      and 9.  The value of the constant should not exceed the
      maximum value that can be stored in an object.
   3. An octal constant is the same as a decimal constant except
      that it begins with a zero.  It is then interpreted in base
      8.  Note that 09 (base 8) is legal and equal to 011.
   4. A character constant is represented by ' followed by one or
      two characters (possibly escaped) followed by another '.
----- page
                       - 8 -

      It has an rvalue equal to the value of the characters
      packed and right adjusted.
   5. A string is any number of characters between " characters.
      The characters are packed into adjacent objects (lvalues
      sequential) and terminated with the character '*e'.  The
      rvalue of the string is the lvalue of the object containing
      the first character.  See section 8.0 for library functions
      used to manipulate strings in a machine independent
      fashion.
   6. Any expression in () parentheses is a primary expression.
      Parentheses are used to alter order of binding.
   7. A vector is a primary expression followed by any expression
      in [] brackets.  The two expressions are evaluated to
      rvalues, added and the result is used as an lvalue.  The
      primary expression can be thought of as a pointer to the
      base of a vector, while the bracketed expression can be
      thought of as the offset in the vector.  Since E1[E2] is
      identical to *(E1+E2), and addition is commutative, the
      base of the vector and the offset in the vector can swap
      positions.
   8. A function is a primary expression followed by any number
      of expressions in () parentheses separated by commas.  The
      expressions in parentheses are evaluated (in an unspecified
      order) to rvalues and assigned to the function's parame-
      ters.  The primary expression is evaluated to an rvalue
      (assumed to be type function).  The function is then
      called.  Each call is recursive at little cost in time or

                          - 9 -

          space.
          
      Primary expressions are bound left to right.

4.2 Unary Operators
   1. The rvalue (or indirection) prefix unary operator * is
      described in section 3.0.  Its operand is evaluated to
      rvalue, and then used as an lvalue.  In this manner, ad-
      dress arithmetic may be performed.
   2. The lvalue (or address) prefix unary operator & is also
      described in section 3.0.  Note that &*x is identically x,
      but *&x is only x if x is an lvalue.
   3. The operand of the negate prefix unary operator - is inter-
      preted as an integer rvalue.  The result is an rvalue with
      opposite sign.
   4. The NOT prefix unary operator ! takes an integer rvalue
      operand.  The result is zero if the operand is non-zero.
      the result is one if the operand is zero.
   5. The increment ++ and decrement -- unary operators may be
      used either in prefix or postfix form.  Either form re-
      quires an lvalue operand.  The rvalue stored in the lvalue
      is either incremented or decremented by one.  The result is
      the rvalue either before or after the operation depending
      on postfix or prefix notation respectively.  Thus if x
      currently contains the rvalue 5, then ++x and x++ both
      change x to 6.  The value of ++x is 6 while x++ is 5.
      Similarly, --x and x-- store 4 in x.  The former has rvalue
      result 4, the latter 5.

----- page
                         - 10 -

   Unary operators are bound right to left.  Thus -!x++ is bound
   -(!(x++)).

4.3 Multiplicative Operators
The multiplicative binary operators *, /, and %, expect rvalue
integer operands.  The result is also an integer.
   1. The operator * denotes multiplication.
   2. The operator / denotes division.  The result is correct if
      the first operand is divisible by the second.  If both
      operands are positive, the result is truncated toward zero.
      Otherwise the rounding is undefined, but never greater than
      one.
   3. The operator % denotes modulo.  If both operands are posi-
      tive, the result is correct.  It is undefined otherwise.

The multiplicative operators bind left to right.

4.4 Additive Operators
The binary operators + and - are add and subtract.  The additive
operators bind left to right.

4.5 Shift Operators
The binary operators << and >> are left and right shif respec-
tively.  The left rvalue operand is taken as a bit pattern.  The
right operand is taken as an integer shift count.  The result is
the bit pattern shifted by the shift count.  Vacated bits are
filled with zeros.  The result is undefined if the shift count is
negative or larger than an object length.  The shift operators
bind left to right.

                         - 11 -

4.6 Relational Operators
The relational operators < (less than), <= (less than or equal
to), > (greater than), and >= (greater than or equal to) take
integer rvalue operands.  The result is one if the operands are
in the given relation to one another.  The result is zero other-
wise.

4.7 Equality Operators
The equality operators == (equal to) and != (not equal to) per-
form similarly to the relation operators.

4.8 AND operator
The AND operator & takes operands as bit patterns.  The result is
the bit pattern that is the bit-wise AND of the operands.  The
AND operator binds and evaluates left to right.

4.9 OR operator
The OR operator | performs exactly as AND, but the result is the
bit-wise inclusive OR of the operands.  The OR operator also
binds and evaluates left to right.

4.10 Conditional Expression
Three rvalue expressions separated by ? and : form a conditional
expression.  The first expression (the the left of the ?) is
evaluated.  If the result is non-zero, the second expression is
evaluated and the third ignored.  If the value is zero, the
second expression is ignored and the third is evaluated.  The
result is either the evaluation of the second or thired expres-
sion.

----- page
                         - 12 -

Binding is right to left.  Thus a?b:c?d:e is a?b:(c?d:e).

4.11 Assignment Operators
There are 16 assignment operators in B.  All have the form
      lvalue op rvalue
The assignment operator = merely evaluates the rvalue and stores
the result in the lvalue.  The assignment operators =|, =&, ===,
=!=, =<, =<=, =>, =>=, =<<, =>>, =+, =-, =%, =*, and =/ perform a
binary operation (see sections 4.3 to 4.9) between the rvalue
stored in the assignment's lvalue and the assignment's rvalue.
The result is then stored in the lvalue.  The expression x=*10 is
identical to x=x*10.  Note that this is not x= *10.  The result
of an assignment is the rvalue.  Assignments bind right to left,
thus x=y=0 assigns zero to y, then x, and returns the rvalue
zero.

5.0 Statements
Statements define program execution.  Each statement is executed
by the computer in sequence.  There are, of course, statements to
conditionally or unconditionally alter normal sequencing.

5.1 Compound Statement
A sequence of statements in {} braces is syntactically a single
statement.  This mechanism is provided so that where a single
statement is expected, any number of statements can be placed.

5.2 Conditional Statement
A conditional statement has two forms.  The first:
      if(rvalue) statement1
----- page
                       - 13 -

evaluates the rvalue and executes statement1 if the rvalue is
non-zero.  If the rvalue is zero, statement1 is skipped.  The
second form:
      if(rvalue statement1 else statement2
is defined as follows in terms of the first form:
      if(x=(rvalue)) statement1 if(!x) statement2
Thus, only one of the two statements is executed, depending on
the value of rvalue.  In the above example, x is not a real vari
able, but just a demonstration aid.

5.3 While Statement
The while statement has the form:
      while(rvalue) statement
The execution is described in terms of the conditional and goto
statements as follows:
      x: if(rvalue) {statement goto x; }
Thus the statement is executed repeatedly while the rvalue is
non-zero.  Again, x is a demonstration aid.

5.4 Switch Statement
The switch statement is the most complicated statement in B.  The
switch has the form:
      switch rvalue statement1
Virtually always, statement1 above is a compound statement.  Each
statement in statement1 may be preceded by a cse as follows:
      case constant:
During execution, the rvalue is evaluated and compared to each
case constant in undefined order.  If a case constant is equal to
----- page
                   - 14 -

the evaluated rvalue, control is passed to the statement follow-
ing the case.  If the rvalue matches none of the cases,
statement1 is skipped.

5.5 Goto Statement
The goto statement is as follows:
      goto rvalue ;
The rvalue is expected to be of type label.  Control is then
passed to the corresponding label.  Got's cannot be executed to
labels outside the currently executing function level.

5.6 Return Statement
The return statement is used in a function to return control to
the caller of  function.  The first form simply returns control.
      return ;
The second form returns an rvalue for the execution of the func-
tion.
      return ( rvalue ) ;
The caller of the function need not use the returned rvalue.

5.7 Rvalue Statement
Any rvalue followed by a semicolon is a statement.  The two most
common rvalue statements are assignment and function call.

5.8 Null Statement
A semicolon is a null statement causing no execution.  It is used
mainly to carry a label after the last executable statement in a
compound statement.  It sometimes has use to supply a null body
to a while statement.

6.0 Declarations
Declarations in B specify storage class of variables.  Such de-
clarations also, in some circumstances, specify initialization.
There are three storage classes in b.  Automatic storage is allo-
cated for each function invocation.  External storage is allocat-
ed before execution and is available to any and all functions.
Internal storage is local to a function and is available only to
that function, but is available to all invocations of that func-
tion.

6.1 External Declaration
The external declaration has the form:
      extrn name1 , name2 ... ;
The external declaration specifies that each of the named vari-
ables is of the external storage class.  The declaration must
occur before the first use of each of the variables.  Each of the
variables must also be externally defined.

6.2 Automatic Declaration
The automatic declaration also constitutes a definition:
      auto name1 {constant}0 1 , name2 {constant}0 1 ... ;
In absence of the constant, the automatic declaration defines the
variable to be of class automatic.  At the same time, storage is
allocated for the variable.  When an automatic declaration is
followed by a constant, the automatic variable is also initial-
ized to the base of an automatic vector of the size of the con-
stant.  The actual subscripts used to reference the vector range
from zero to the value of the constant less one.
----- page
                - 16 -

6.3 Internal Declaration
The first reference to a variable not declared as external or
automatic constitutes an internal declaration.  All internal
variables not defined as labels are flagged as undefined within a
function.  Labels are defined and initialized as follows:
      name ;

7.0 External Definitions
A complete B program consists of a series of external defini-
tions.  Execution is started by the hidden sequence
      main(); exit();
Thus, it is expected that one of the external definitions is a
function definition of main.  (Exit is a predefined library func-
tion.  See section 8.0)

7.1 Simple Definition
The simple external definition allocates an external object and
optionally initializes it:
      name {ival , ival ... } 0 ;
If the external object is defined with no initialization, it is
initialized with zero.  A single initialization with a constant
initializes the external with the value of the constant.  Initial-
ization with a name initializes the external to the address of
that name.  Many such initializations may be accessed as a vector
based at &name.

7.2 Vector Definitions
An external vector definition has the following form:
----- page
                      - 17 -

      name [ {constant}0 1 ] { ival , ival ... }0 ;
The name is initialized with the lvalue of the base of an exter-
nal vector.  If the vector size is missing, zero is assumed.  In
either case, the vector is initialized with the list of initial
values.  Each initial value is either a constant or a name.  A
constant initial value initializes the vector element to the
value of the constant.  The name initializes the element to the
address of the name.  The actual size of the vector is the max-
imum of the given size and the number of initial values.

7.3 Function Definitions
Function definitions have the following form:
      name ( arguments ) statement
The name is initialized to the rvalue of the function.  The argu-
ments constist of a list of names separated by commas.  Each name
defines an automatic lvalue that is assigned the rvalue of the
corresponding function call actual parameters.  The statement
(often compound) defines the execution of the function when in-
voked.

8.0 Library Functions
There is a library of B functions maintained in the file
/etc/libb.a.  The following is a list of those functions current-
ly in the library.  See section II of [4] for complete descrip-
tions of the functions marked with an *.

   c = char(string, i);
      The i-th character of the string is returned.

   error = chdir(string);
      The path name represented by the string becomes the current

                       - 18 -

      directory.  A negative number returned indicates an error.
      (*)
   error = chmod(string, mode);
      The file specified by the string has its mode changed to
      the mode argument.  A negative number returned indicates an
      error.  (*)
   error = chown(string, owner);
      The file specified by the string has its owner changed to
      the owner argument.  A negative number returned indicates
      an error.  (*)

   error - close(file);
      The open file specified by the file argument is closed.  A
      negative number returned indicates an error.  (*)

   file - creat(string, mode);
      The file specified by the string is either truncated or
      created in the mode specified depending on its prior exis-
      tance.  In both cases, the file is opened for writing and a
      file descriptor is returned.  A negative number returned
      indicates an error.  (*)

   ctime(time, date);
      The system time (60-ths of a second) represented in the
      two-word vector time is converted to a 16-character date in
      the 8-word vector date.  The converted date has the follow-
      ing format: "Mmm dd hh:mm:ss".

   execl(string, arg0, arg1, ..., 0);
      The current process is replaced by the execution of the
      file specified by string.  The arg-i strings are passed as
      arguments.  A return indicates an error.  (*)

   execv(string, argv, count);
      The current process is replaced by the execution of the
      file specified by string.  The vector of strings of length
      count are passed as arguments.  A return indicates an er-
      ror.  (*)

   exit();
      The current process is terminated.  (*)

   error = fork();
      The current process splits into two.  The child process is
      returned a zero.  The parent process is returned the pro-
      cess ID of the child.  A negative number returned indicates
      an error.  (*)

   error = fstat(file, status);
      The i-node of the open file designated by file is put in
      the 20-word vector status.  A negative number returned

----- page
                    - 19 -

      indicates an error. (*)

   char = getchar();
      The next character form(sic) the standard input file is re-
      turned.  The character '*e' is returned for an end-of-file.

   id = getuid();
      The user-ID of the current process is returned. (*)

   error = gtty(file, ttystat);
      The teletype modes of the open file designated by file is
      returned in the 3-word vector ttystat.  A negative number
      returned indicates an error.  (*)

   lchar(string, i, char);
      The character char is stored in the i-th character of the
      string.

   error = link(string1, string2);
      The pathname specified by string2 is created such that it
      is a link to the existing file specified by string1.  A
      negative number returned indicates an error.  (*)

   error = mkidr(string, mode);
      The directory specified by the string is made to exist with
      the specified access mode.  A negative number returned
      indicates an error.  (*)

   file = open(string, mode)
      The file specified by the string is opened for reading if
      mode is zero, for writing if mode is not zero.  The open
      file designator is returned.  A negative number returned
      indicates an error.  (*)

   printf(format, arg1, ...);
      See section 9.3 below.

   printn(number, base);
      See section 9.1 below.

   putchar(char);
      The character char is written on the standard output file.

   nread = read(file, buffer, count);
      Count bytes are read into the vector buffer from the open
      file designated by file.  The actual number of bytes read
      are returned.  A negative number returned indicates an
      error.  (*)

   error = seek(file, offset, pointer);
      The I/O pointer on the open file designated by file is set
      to the value of the designated pointer plus the offset.  A
      pointer of zero designates the beginning of the file.  A

      pointer of one designates the current I/O pointer.  A
      pointer of two designates the end of the file.  A negative
      number returned indicates an error.  (*)

   error = setuid(id);
      The user-ID of the current process is set to id.  A nega-
      tive number returned indicates an error.  (*)

   error = stat(string, status);
      the i-node of the file specified by the string is put in
      the 20-word vector status.  A negative number returned
      indicates an error. (*)

   error = stty(file, ttystat);
      The teltype modes of the open file designated by file is
      set from the 3-word vector ttystat.  A negative number
      returned indicates an error.  (*)

   time(timev);
      The current system time is returned in the 2-word vector
      timev.  (*);

   error = unlink(string);
      The link specified by the string is removed.  A negative
      number returned indicates an error.  (*)

   error = wait();
      The current process is suspended until one of its child
      processes terminates.  At that time, the child's process-ID
      is returned.  A negative number returned indicates an er-
      ror.  (*)

   nwrite = write(file, buffer, count);
      Count bytes are written out of the vector buffer on the
      open file designated by file.  The actual number of bytes
      written are returned.  A negative number returned indicates
      an error.  (*)

Besides the functions available from the library, there is a
predefined external vector named argv included with every pro-
gram.  The size of argv is argv[0]+1.  The elements
argv[1]...argv[argv[0]] are the parameter strings as passed by
the system in the execution of the current process.  (See shell
in II of [4])

10.0 Usage

Currently on UNIX, there is no B command.  The B compiler phases
must be executed piecemeal.  The first phase turns a B source
program into an intermediate language.
   /etc/bc source interm
The next phase turns the intermediate language into assembler
source, at which time the intermediate language can be removed.
   /etc/ba interm asource
   rm interm
The next phase assembles the assembler source into the object
file a.out.  After this the a.out file can be renamed and the
assembler source file can be removed.
   as asource
   mv a.out object
   rm asource
The last phase loads the various object files with the necessary
libraries in the desired order.
   ld object /etc/brt1 -lb /etc/bilib /etc/brt2
Now a.out contains the completely bound and loaded program and
can be executed.
   a.out
A canned sequence of shell commands exists invoked as follows
   sh /usr/b/rc x
It will compile, convert, assemble and load the file x.b into
executable file a.out.

12.0 Implementation and Debugging

A B program is implemented as a reverse Polish threaded code
interpreter: The object code consists of a series of address of
interpreter subroutines.  Machine register 3 is dedicated as the
interpreter program counter.  Machine register 4 is dedicated as
the interpreter display pointer.  The display pointer points to
the base of the current stack frame.  The first word of each
stack frame is a pointer to the previous stack frame (prior
display pointer.) The second word in each frame is is (sic) the saved
interpreter program counter (return point of the call creating
the frame.) Automatic variables start at the third word of each
frame.  Machine register 5 is dedicated as the interpreter stack
pointer.  The machine stack pointer plays no role in the in-
terpretation.  An example source code segment, object code and
interpreter subroutines follow:
       automatic = external + 100.;

       va; 4                   / lvalue of first automatic on
stack
       x; .external            /rvalue of external on stack
       c; 100.                 /rvalue of constant on stack
       b12                     /binary operator #12 (+)
       b1                      /binary operator #1 (=)
       ...

va:
       mov    (r3)+,r0         
       add    r4,r0            /dp+offset of automatic
       asr    r0               /lvalues are word addresses
       mov    r0, (r5)+
       jmp    *(r3)+           /linkage between subroutines

x:
       mov    *(r3)+,(r5)+
       jmp    *(r3)+

c:
       mov    (r3)+,(r5)+
----- page
                        - 25 -

       jmp    *(r3)+

b12:
       add    -(r5),-2(r5)
       jmp    *(r3)+

b1:
       mov    -(r5),r0         / rvalue
       mov    -(r5),r1         / lvalue
       asl    r1               / now byte address
       mov    r0,(r1)          / actual assignment
       mov    r0,(r5)+         / = returns an rvalue
       jmp    *(r3)+

The above code as compared to the obvious 3 instruction directly
executed equivalent gives the approximate 5:1 speed and 2:1 space
penalties one pays in using B.

The salient features for debugging are then:
   1. Machine r4 is the display pointer and can be used to trace
      function calls and determine automatic variable values at
      each call
   2. Machine r3 is the current program counter and can be used
      to determine the current point of execution.
   3. All externals are globals with their variable names pre-
      fixed by '.'.  Thus the debugger [4] can be used directly
      to give values of external variables.
   4. All data lvalues are word addresses and therefore not
      directly examinable by the debugger.  (See ' request in I
      of [4])

13.0 Nasties
This section describes the 'glitches' found in all languages, but
rarely reported.
   1. The compiler makes sense of certain expressions with
----- page
                         - 26 -

      operators in ambiguous cases (e.g. a+++b) but not others
      even in unambiguous cases (e.g. a+++++b).
   2. The B assembler /etc/ba does not correctly handle all pos-
      sible combinations of intermediate language.  The symptom
      is undefined symbols in the assembly of the output from
      /etc/ba.  This is rare.
   3. The B interpreter /etc/bilib is really a library of thread-
      ed code segments.  The following code segments have not yet
      been written:
             b103   =&
             b104   ===
             b105   =!=
             b106   =<=
             b107   =<
             b110   =>=
             b111   =>
             b120   =/
    4. Initialization of external variables with addresses of oth-
       er externals is not possible due to a loader deficiency.
    5. Since externals are implemented as globals with names pre-
       ceded by '.', the external names 'byte', 'endif', 'even'
       and 'globl' conflict with assembler pseodooperations (sic) and
       should be avoided.

14.0 Diagnostics
Diagnostics consist of two letters, an optional name, and a
source line number.  Due to the free format of the source, the
source line number might be high.  The following is a list of the
diagnostics.
